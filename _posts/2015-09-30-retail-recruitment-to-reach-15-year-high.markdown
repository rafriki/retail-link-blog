I was delighted to see that more than a third of retailers have increased staff numbers this year.
So it’s hardly any surprise that the recruitment rate is likely to reach a 15-year peak in 2015, according to Retail Week (27th August 2015).

This just goes to show how important the retail sector is to the UK. With the economy picking up nicely, consumers are flocking to town centres and malls to spend their money. But they are still shopping around for the bargains.

At Retail Link, we are seeing a big uptick in client demand for staff and are working hard to successfully satisfy that demand. Competition is particularly keen in roles such as analytics (for shopper and employee behaviours) that require tech-savvy candidates. With a shortage of digital skills across all sectors, Retailers need to be prepared for pressure on salaries. 

Another area that I predict will become a hot topic in Retail is staff retention. When it’s tough to attract the right talent then you don’t want to see them walking away too soon. What keeps employees loyal? That’s the subject of a whole other blog – watch this space!
