I commented on zero-hours contracts in a previous blog.
It was a big topic during the General Election, and it cropped up again recently with some new data from the Office for National Statistics.

Once again, zero hours contracts provoked fierce debate. The ONS revealed that around 1.5 million zero hours contracts were issued by UK businesses in January, a rise from the previous number of 1.4 million.

## Zero hours contracts – flexible for students and mothers

But while some people on zero hours contracts are upset that they are not guaranteed a minimum number of hours, others, especially students and mothers of young children, argue that that they offer greater flexibility in working patterns.

Of those working on zero-hours contracts, 54% were women, while 34% were aged 16 to 24 and 6% aged 65 and over.

A further 20% of people on zero hours contracts were in full-time education. On average, someone on a zero-hours contract usually works 25 hours a week, with around 40% of them wanting more.

As I wrote last time, zero hours contracts are not universally bad. They offer flexibility welcomed by many. They may well be part of the reason for lower unemployment in the UK than other part of the European Union, enabling employers to hold onto staff to meet changing needs.

## Those contracts don’t offer stability for some workers

But I accept they are not always good for people who need guaranteed or more hours to make ends meet. And retailers should ensure workers on these contracts are not abused.

But many employers such as Sainsbury’s now pay well above the minimum wage, and offer good career progression. 

Ideally, we want to see more permanent jobs in retail. It is a great industry with many good employers, and offers a lot of opportunities and good careers.
