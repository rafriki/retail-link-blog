When Craig Vidler, chairman of Retail Link, held his first charity fly-fishing day 27 years ago, it raised £1,000 for good retail causes.

Since then, the annual two-day event that attracts leading lights from the retail and other sectors, including show business, has netted more than £500,000 for the Retail Trust.

Craig’s latest fishing fest, held recently in Dever Springs, Hampshire, and attended by 35 guests, raised a record-breaking £22,000.

Craig, a Retail Trust ambassador, and his wife Marjie have worked tirelessly over the years to raise money for the Trust’s good causes, including homes for retired retailers.

The event, supported by HR GO plc, Ted Baker and Peel Outlets, also raised money from a charity auction of prizes such as Take That concert tickets.

Craig, a past Retail Trust trustee and director, said: “It has been an absolute pleasure running this event over the past 27 years and I’m grateful to so many people for their generosity.”
