W H Smith, the newspaper, magazine, book and stationery retailer, has been criticized for allegedly charging more in its hospital outlets than shops elsewhere. Patient groups are outraged. The retailer defended the decision by saying that overheads were higher in hospital.

## Different prices for same goods

Many retailers charge different prices for the same goods according to the size and location of the outlet. It might be simple economics but I fully recognise that it upsets patients and other customers with nowhere else to shop. And some of the differences were very high. 
In general I would rather see these shops stay open than close, albeit with higher charges, because they provide a valuable service and offer good employment opportunities. 

Latest news is, after pressure from MP Paula Sherriff, that the firm is reconsidering and now says it will match stationery prices and cut food and drink costs. Consumer groups are hoping other retailers in similar situations will follow suit.
