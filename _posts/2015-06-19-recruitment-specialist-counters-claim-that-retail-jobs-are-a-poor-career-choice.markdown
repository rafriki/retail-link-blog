Retailers have a long way to go to convince consumers the industry offers good jobs, according to a survey.

An ICM poll for Retail Week found that only one in six (17%) regard it as good career choice. This ranks it third from bottom in a list of 14 sectors, finishing ahead of only charity work and agriculture.

Yet retail is now the biggest employment sector in the UK.

Experts believe the poor image is because most people think it only offers entry-level jobs. But Richard Pennycook, Co-operative Group chief executive, told Retail Week that many people in retail boardrooms had started on the shop floor. “It’s one of the most meritocratic sectors and we need to make more of that,” he said. “Retail is a fabulous sector and people who progress through it develop enviable skills.”

The poll found that fewer than one in 10 consumers thought retail offered well-paid jobs.

Tim Elliott, head of retail recruitment at Retail Link, said there were many misconceptions about the industry. “We work with many retailers to find them talented staff at all levels. Many at management level began their career serving customers on the shop floor and it’s an ideal platform for a successful career offering good salaries.”

He added: “I agree that there is a popular perception that the only work available in retail is at the check-out or in a warehouse. But this is a false impression because many of the clients we work for offer a wide range of jobs, many in senior roles and others that offer a pathway to senior positions. Retail is a great industry to join – and there are so many opportunities that both new entrants and experienced staff will be spoilt for choice.”
