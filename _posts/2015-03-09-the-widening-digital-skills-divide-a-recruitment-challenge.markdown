This is a biggie, and one that almost every business is grappling with.
It’s been estimated that more than four million IT jobs will be created around Big Data by the end of 2015.
Yet research suggests that only a third of these jobs are likely to be filled. Martha Lane Fox, the founder of holiday bookings website LastMinute.com and the UK digital inclusion champion, believes more than 16 million people in the UK lack the basic skills to fully benefit from the Internet.
According to a report by Capgemini Consulting “The Digital Talent Gap: Developing Sills for Today’s Digital Organisations”, even so-called Millennials – Generations X, Y and Z – do not have all the answers. One in five in the modern workplace lack analytical skills.
The impact of digital technologies is now felt not only in IT but also across the entire organisation. The report says the magnitude of training and re-skilling is enormous.

## Experienced staff are soon beyond their sell-by date 

One boss said: “The shelf life of a software engineer today is no more than that of a cricketer – about 15 years. The 20-year-old guys provide me more value than the 35-year-olds do.”
Digital talent does not lend itself to easy recruitment. 
Indeed, a survey indicates that over 49% of candidates are more likely to consider a job advertised in an innovative way. The same survey found that over three-quarters of HR professionals think that it has become crucial to use new ways to recruit and retain talent.
At Retail Link, we are geared up to meet client’s digital needs. Digital skills are vital to gaining competitive advantage and we have a large database of people with those skills. We screen them to ensure the skills they have already, or the aptitude they show for developing those skills, are right for the client.

## The lack of digital skills- main obstacle to digital transformation 

I see that nearly 80% of companies consider that the lack of digital skills is their main hurdle to digital transformation. Digital leaders – or Digirati as they are sometimes called - are investing in digital skills and reaping significant competitive advantage.  Digirati on average are likely to be 26% more profitable than competitors.

Employers should consider digital skills as key components of their workforce plans. Because this skills shortage is creating a war for talent, we are best placed to help clients win the war. 
I would urge employers to analyse existing workforce digital skills and identify any skills gaps that we can help to bridge.
Once that’s achieved, employers need to sustain competitive advantage by training, re-skilling and hiring people equipped with the latest digital skills. 
We assist clients to identify people with the appropriate digital skills so businesses can stay ahead of the pack in this era of digital transformation.
