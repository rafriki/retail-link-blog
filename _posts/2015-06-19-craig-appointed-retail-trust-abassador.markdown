After more than 40 years in the retail industry, including recruiting many of its most senior figures, Craig Vidler has been appointed a Retail Trust ambassador.

The voluntary role is a fine reward for a lifetime of service to the industry he loves.

As chairman of Retail Link, a sector specialist, he has a strong track record of finding the best people and promoting retail as a great career choice for talented people of all ages and abilities.

Under Craig’s leadership, Star Executives became one of the biggest retail recruitment names in the UK. He owns and runs the Prima Principia recruitment consultancy and Grey4Gold, which finds experienced retail mentors.

For the past six years, he has been a senior figure in HR GO plc, a £90 million national recruitment business founded 60 years ago, for the past two years as group managing director.

Craig, a former director and trustee of Retail Trust, has raised more than £500,000 for good retail causes from his annual two-day fly fishing event.

Craig said: “I’m very happy to be associated with this important charity over so many years and am delighted to continue that link as a Retail Trust ambassador.”
