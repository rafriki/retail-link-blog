Hilco Capital, the global leader in distressed investment and advisory services, has celebrated 15 years in business.

Retail Link has worked closely with the company for the past four years.

The specialist recruiter has supplied staff for several major retail restructuring programmes, including Habitat, JJB Sports and Clintons.

Tim Elliott, head of recruitment at Retail Link, attended the 15th Anniversary Hilco Fest on the 38th floor of London’s Heron Tower.

More than 200 guests enjoyed sushi in Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian style, with live music from the Stereophonics Indie rock band.

“Retail Link has supplied Hilco Capital with all the temporary staffing on recent store closure programmes,” Tim said. “We have built up a great relationship over the years, working on some very tight lead times.

“Carrying out a store closure or staging a promotional event is always a challenge, but we work well as a team and have delivered some great results.”

He added: “We look forward to supporting Hilco for many years to come. It’s a great business to work with. A big thank you to Hilco Capital for a great night.”

Paul McGowan, who attended the celebration, founded Hilco Capital in 2000, in partnership with US-based Hilco Global. It has been involved in many of the most notable restructuring projects of recent years.
